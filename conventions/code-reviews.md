# Code Reviews

1. The implementer is responsible for driving the feature through the project board and if needed, the implementor should ask peers for code review.
2. At least one round of code review must be done by someone outside the original product team
3. The emphasis of second code review is to protect applications or libraries from publishing **breaking** changes.
4. During second code review the priority is to fix forward rather than block. In cases where non-breaking issues are surfaced JIRA tickets must be created and referenced within the PR
