# Code Reviews

1. The implementer is responsible to drive the feature, and so to ask other developers for reviews
2. The second code review must be done by someone outside the original product team
3. The emphasis of second code review is to protect applications or libraries from publishing **breaking** changes.
4. During second code review the priority is to fix forward rather than block. In cases where non-breaking issues are surfaced JIRA tickets must be created and referenced within the PR

_Initially ratified in the Friday Meeting of the 26th Jan 2018_
